This project is a **Java** application designed for managing student information as part of **Exercise 3**. It utilizes **inheritance** to structure its classes efficiently, allowing for adding students and handling access permissions, while processing and storing data with simple data structures and supporting specific input formats.

## **Features**
- **Add Student**: Register student details such as first name, last name, student ID, password, birth year, and address.
- **Access Management**: Supports **Admin** and **Regular User** roles with different access levels.
- **Inheritance-Based Design**: Uses Java inheritance to organize classes, enhancing code modularity and reusability.
- **Persian Language Support**: Processes Persian inputs for names and addresses.

1. **Install JDK**: Ensure JDK version 8 or higher is installed.
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
   ```
3. **Compile and Run**:
   ```bash
